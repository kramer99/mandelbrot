mandelbrot
==========

Mandelbrot fractal renderer with real-time zoom and logarithmically interpolated coloring.  It will also divide the work and utilize as many cores as your processor has available.

Only works on windows.  To run on Mac or Linux, just replace lib/swt.jar with the Mac or Linux version found here: http://www.eclipse.org/swt/

Take a look in [example-images](https://github.com/kramer99/mandelbrot/tree/master/example-images) for some pretty pictures.
